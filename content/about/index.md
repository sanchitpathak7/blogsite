I have a profound passion for tackling complex challenges in cloud infrastructure across diverse platforms. My expertise revolves around leveraging Infrastructure as Code tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Saltstack, coupled with CI/CD pipelines. I excel in Docker, Kubernetes, and other cutting-edge technologies, embracing cloud-native and agile principles wholeheartedly. Recently, I've been delving deeper into Data Structures and Algorithms, enhancing my proficiency in Python and Bash scripting along the way.

Currently working as a Cloud Operations Engineer at [Platform9 Systems](https://platform9.com) with overall experience of 5 years in this domain.
